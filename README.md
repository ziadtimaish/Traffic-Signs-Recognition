# Traffic Signs Recognition with Deep Learning

This project implements a deep learning model to classify traffic signs using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The model is trained on a dataset of traffic signs and achieves high accuracy in detecting and classifying them. This application can be used for developing autonomous driving systems or assisting drivers by identifying traffic signs in real-time.

## Features

- **Traffic Sign Classification:** The model classifies various traffic signs such as speed limits, warning signs, and prohibitory signs.
- **CNN Architecture:** Uses a Convolutional Neural Network for image classification.
- **Real-time Predictions:** Capable of performing real-time predictions on traffic signs.
- **Model Training:** Includes Jupyter Notebook code for training the model from scratch.
- **Dataset Preprocessing:** Preprocessing steps such as normalization and resizing of images are included.
